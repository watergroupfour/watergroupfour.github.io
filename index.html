            <hr>
            <p class="text">The aim of the project was to see how the velocity of
                the water current affected the rates of dissolution of minerals, 
                affecting the pH of the water body and environment for biological growth. 
                In theory, stagnant water (water that is not flowing) would have a low 
                rate of mineral dissolution while flowing water would have a high rate of dissolution.
                <br><br>
                To better understand this concept, it helps to look at stirring a solvent in a 
                solute as an example of the high rate of dissolution. Stirring affects the rate
                of dissolving because it spreads the solvent's molecules around the solute and 
                increases the chance of them coming into contact with it. Because of this, stirring
                makes solvents dissolve faster. The same idea can be used to understand a how minerals
                would dissolve in a moving stream of water.
                <br><br>
                Thus, water with a high mineral content would provide a suitable environment for biological growth.

                Avi, and myself took it upon ourselves to investigate the velocity of the current of the water.
                We devised a simple scheme to place a pinball in the canal, and measure the time it takes to
                cross over a certain distance. What we found however, was that the pinball was hardly
                moving and even sometimes moving backwards. 
                <br><br>
                Jon joined us in theorizing upon the
                reasons why, and it occurred to us that the movement was simply a sign of wind force. This
                explained why another group conducting experiments in the canal were reporting the flow of
                water switching velocities.
                <br><br>
                What we came upon was that the average current velocity of the water
                was effectively zero, and reported our findings to Sara who was conducting water samples,
                to see if this revelation might affect her hypothesis of presence of life in the canal.

                In the eyes of a biologist, the most interesting data collected would most likely be 
                the transmittance of the water, and how it can show us how much life there is in the 
                Ruoholahti canal. The most accessible way to do this with the school’s equipment was 
                the Colorimeter. It measures how much light goes through the water, and from this we 
                can assume how much life, even if it is only microscopic, is present in the water. If
                less light passes through, there should be more microorganisms.
                <br><br>
                The transmittance data collected shows how there might be different amounts of
                organisms in different spots of the canal, so since 84,04% of light went through 
                the water in sample 1, we could assume that there is more algae or perhaps phytoplankton
                present.
                <br><br>
                The conductivity data can also give interesting information – the higher the conductivity,
                the more ions we can assume are present, and these ions might affect the life forms in the
                water. However the highest conductivity measurement is in sample 3, with 4745, and this is
                where there is the highest transmittance. Drinking water is rated from 50 to 500&micro;S/cm
                (microsiemens per centimetre), nearly ten times higher than our average measuremnt, so the 
                water contains more ions that ideal for drinking.
                <br><br>
                In order to further understand and spot trends on all the data, some simple statistical analysis
                should be conducted, such as a t-test.

            <hr>
            <p class="text">
                Measuring the pH of an aqueous solution can be done in few simple ways using pH 
                test paper, pH indicator or pH meter.  For this experiment we used an electronic
                pH meter, which measures the hydrogen ion concentration in the canal water to determine its pH.
                <br><br>
                Pure water has a pH of 7, which is in the middle of the 0-14 pH scale and is neutral. The
                data of canal water collected by our group shows an average pH of 7.3, which means the water
                is neutral. Most freshwater sources have a natural pH ranging from 6 to 8. 
                <br><br>
                The issue becomes harmful below levels of 6 and even more so below 5 as most aquatic systems
                fail then. When pH does drop to 5, non-desirable species of plankton and mosses start to appear
                and at a pH of 4 fish populations begin to die off. 
                <br><br>
                These issues however do not affect the canal water as our sample data shows a pH of 7.3, 0.3 
                away from what is considered pure water with pH of 7 meaning currently the acidity of the 
                water by itself has no negative effects on marine life in the canal.
